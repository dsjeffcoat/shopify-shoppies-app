# Shopify Shoppies App Challenge

The following project is my submission for the Shopify Coding Challenge for the 2021 Summer Internship. Features within the project are as follows:

- Movie search through OMDB API
- Ability to nominate movies to your favorites
- Ability to remove picked nominations through a nominations overlay
- Modal presented when all five nominees are selected

OMDB API Primary Source: http://www.omdbapi.com/

## Additional Notes:

Originally, I tried to work with React to get everything put in place. However, there were several issues that I had at deployment, so I switched to a static page with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with jQuery added. Some of the functionality is still in progress, but I've been working hard to get all the functionality alongside my design skills and knowledge. However, I will continue to work on this even outside of the challenge.
